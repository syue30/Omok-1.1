# Omok-1.1
A small game of connect 5 made in PyGame

I made this game as sort of a prelude to  my A* Pathfinding algorithm project. I wanted to learn how to draw grids, backdrops and place items on a grid in PyGame.
This is my first ever project with PyGame so the code is a little messy.

I am still refining this project.
